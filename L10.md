# Generics

Generics means parameterized types.

Using generics, it is possible to create a single class, that automatically works with different types of data.

It is always possible to work with Object class as general type for any object, generics adds type-safety to Java.

Note for C++ developers: Java generics != C++ templates, despite syntax is close.

```
class X<T> {
	private T value;
	public T getValue() { ... }
	public void setValue(T value) { ... }
}

X<Integer> obj = new X<Integer>();
```

Here, T is the name of a type parameter. This name is used as a placeholder for the actual type.

Java compiler does not actually create different versions of generic class.
Instead, the compiler removes all generic type information, substituting the
necessary casts, to make your code behave as if a specific version of class were
created. Thus, there is really only one version of class that actually exists in
your program. The process of removing generic type information is called
__erasure__. Compare this to C++ templates.

Generics only work with Object types (no int, char, double, ...)

Generic types with different type-arguments are not compatible: X<Integer> vs X<Double> - can not cast one to another.

## Bounded classes

<__T__ extends __superclass__>

public class X<T extends Number> { ... }

Can bound with interfaces too. Or even class + interfaces

<__T__ extends __class__ & __interface1__ & __interface2__>

The wildcard argument is specified by the ?, and it represents an unknown type.

```
class X<T> {
	public void compare(X<?> anotherTypeArg) { ... }
}
```

Wildcard arguments can also be bounded.

public void compare<X<? extends Number> anotherTypeArg)

With wildcards it is also possible to define the lower bound - only classes that are superclasses of subclass are acceptable
arguments:

```
<? super subclass>
```

## Generic methods

You can create generic methods for non-generic class:

```
class A {
	public <T> static void method(T arg);
}
```

Calling of the generic method can be specified:

```
A.method(10); // T == Integer

Object obj = new String();
A.<String>method(obj); // Call with T == String 
```

Constructors can also me generic for non-generic classes

## Generic interfaces

Interfaces can also be specified as generics, same as classes.

## Using __raw__ type for generic class

In neneral, not specifying generic type-arg means - use Object class for it.

```
X<Object> x;
X y; // same type as x
```

Of cause we are loosing any safety here.

## Generics at runtime

There is no __runtime__ information for generics, genrics are __compile__ time __ONLY__.

```
if(x instanceod X<?>) // GOOD CODE
if(x instanceof X<Integer>) // WRONG CODE
```

## Casting

You can cast one instance of a generic class into another only if the two are otherwise
compatible and their type arguments are the same.

## Diamond operator

In modern versions of java instead of:

```
X<Integer, String> x = new X<Integer, String>(10, "hello");
```

we can use this form:

```
X<Integer, String> x = new X<>(10, "hello");
```

Here is __<>__ is __diamond__ operator - compiler __KNOWS__ what types to use besause in the left part of expression
types are already defined.

## Var and generics

var mcOb = new MyClass<Integer, String>(98, "A String");

## Erasure

When your Java code is compiled, all
generic type information is removed (erased). This means replacing type
parameters with their bound type, which is Object if no explicit bound is
specified, and then applying the appropriate casts (as determined by the type
arguments) to maintain type compatibility with the types specified by the type
arguments. The compiler also enforces this type compatibility. This approach
to generics means that no type parameters exist at run time. They are simply a
source-code mechanism.

## Ambiguity Errors

```
class X<T, V> {
	private T t;
	private V v;
	
	public void set(T t) {
		this.t = t;
	}
	
	public void set(V v) {
		this.v = v;
	}
}

X<Integer, String> x1 = new X<>();
x1.set(10);
x1.set("Hello");

X<Integer, Integer> x2 = new X<>();
x1.set(10); // ??? T or V here????
```

How to solve? Use different method names!

## Generics restrictions

Type parameters can not be instantiated:

t = new T(); // Where T is type-parameter - ERROR

Type-args of class can not be used in static members/methods

Arrays:

a = new T[10]; // ERROR

X<Integer> a[] = new X<Integer>[10]; // ERROR
X<?> a[] = new X<?>[10]; // OK

Generic class can __NOT__ extends __Throwable__ - no generics for exceptions

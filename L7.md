# Multithread programming

## Basics

Thread states
* runnable
* new
* blocked
* terminated
* waiting

Thread priorities are integeres defining relative priority (thread vs thread)

Synchronization primitive in Java - monitor - only one thread can 'hold' the monitor at the same time. Every Object has it's own monitor.

java.lang.Thread class and java.lang.Runnable interface - the base of multithreading in Java

Main thread in java. Thread.currentThread() static method. Thread.sleep() method.

Creating a thread. Creating extending Thread class. Creating implementing Runnable interface. Which is preferred?

Creating multiple threads. Using isAlive() and join().

Thread priorities. setPriority(n) method. MIN\_PRIORITY and MAX\_PRIORITY

## Synchronization basics

'synchronized' keyword for class, method, in-method.

## Interthread communication

wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods

Deadlocks in Java. Common rule to avoid deadlocks

## Deprecated methods

suspend(), stop() and resume() are deprecated - show NOT be used

## Thread state

Thread.getState() returns the state of the thread

# Exception handling

An exception is an abnormal condition that arises in a code sequence at run time - run-time error.

Java exception is an object that describes an exceptional condition that has occurred in a piece of code.

Keywords:

* try
* catch
* throw
* throws
* finally

## Exception Types

* Throwable
* - Exception (exceptional conditions)
* - - RuntimeException (autohandled)
* - Error (java vm errors)

## Try/catch

! Example - division by zero
! Stack trace in the example above

! Exampe - using try/catch
! Program code after exception throws is ignored

! Exaple - multiple catch clauses
! Order of catch clauses is important

! Example - nested try blocks

## Throw

Use 'throw' go generate new exception

! Example of 'throw'

## Throws

If a method is capable of causing an exception that it does not handle, it must
specify this behavior so that callers of the method can guard themselves against
that exception.

Do not need to specify 'throws' for Error and RuntimeException types.

## Finally

Execute after try/catch block regardless of if exception was throws/cached or not.

## Java build-in exceptions

Some RuntimeException subclasses:

* AriphmeticException
* ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
* ClassCastException
* IllegalArgumentException
* NullPointerException
* UnsupportedOperationException

Some Exception subclasses (not RuntimeException)

* ClassNotFoundException
* IllegalAccessException
* InstantiationException
* InterruptedException

## Creating own exception subclasses

Just define the subclass of Exception

! Example

Usually define public constructors (no-arg and message-arg)

## Chained exceptions

To have a chain of exceptions (cause-ex constructors)

! Example
! getCause() method

## Multy catch (java-7)

catch(Exception1 | Exception2 e) { ... }

## Accesing stack trace

! Example of Throwable.getStackTrace()

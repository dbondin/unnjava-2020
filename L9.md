# I/O Basics

Java programs perform I/O through streams.

A stream is an abstraction that either produces or consumes information.

Input stream can abstract many different kinds of input: from a disk file,
a keyboard, or a network socket. Likewise, an output stream may refer to the
console, a disk file, or a network connection.

Package: java.io.*

2 types of streams:

* byte streams
* character streams

## Byte streams

* __InputStream__ byte input stream - top abstract class for all input streams
* __OutputStream__ byte output stream - top abstract class for all output streams
* Buffered...
* ByteArray...
* Data...
* File...
* Object...
* PrintStream
* many others ...

Most important methods are __read()__ and __write()__

## Character streams

* __Reader__ buffered input character stream
* __Writer__ buffered output character stream
* CharArray...
* File...
* Input/OutputStream...
* String...
* PrintWriter

Most important methods - __read()__ and __write()__ for charscters

Predefined streams:

* System.in (InputStream, FD0)
* System.out (PrintStream, FD1)
* System.err (PrintStream, FD2)

Reading console out: use BufferedReader as wrapper over System.in and use read() and readLine() methods.
And use java.util.Scanner for formatted input (like scanf() in C)

Writing co console: System.out/err and methods write(), print(), println().
To enable automatic flush wrap with PrintWriter.

## Reading and writing files
 
* FileInputStream
* FileOutputStream

Common exception: IOException (and all subclasses).

Wrap with Reader/Writer for character I/O.

Use __close()__ method to close file streams.

Automatically closing a file stream: use try-with-resource

```
try(AutoCloseable resource definition) {
...
}
```

## transient and volative keywords

__transient__ - value need not persist when an object is stored with Object...Stream

__volative__ - can be changed unexpectedly by other parts of your program - for multithread programs,
in general - force the read/write of value from main memory (not cache) and apply monitor acuire/release
(check JMM here)

# Native methods (concept)

In some situations you can want to use native (not java) code in your java program. You can define method as __native__
to mark what it's implementation should be found in external dynamic library (.dll or .so).

The name for this is __JNI__ - Java Native Interface

# Assertions

__assert__ keyword can be used to specify conditinal logical errors in program.

```
assert x > 0
```

Program will fail with AssertionExcption if x will be less or equal to zero.

You can enable/disable assertions in runtime with __-da__ and __-ea__ options.

# Static imports

You can import static methods using __import static__.

# Invoking overloaded constructors with this()

One constructor can call another using this() notation (Compare with calling parent constructor with super())

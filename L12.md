# Java GUI (AWT and Swing)

Some well-known GUI libraries for Java:

* AWT
* Swing
* JXF
* SWT

**AWT** - Abstract Window Toolkit - old GUI components in Java standard library

**Swing** - newer GUI components in Java standard library (build on the top of AWT)

AWT componets are mapped to OS platform-specific GUI components.

Most of Swing components are lightweight. This means that
they are written entirely in Java and do not map directly to platform-specific
peers. (Not like AWT)

Swing supports a pluggable look and feel (PLAF).

A Swing GUI consists of two key items: components and containers

A component is an independent visual control, such as a push button or slider.

A container holds a group of components. Container itself is a component.

Because containers are components, a container can also hold other containers.
This enables Swing to define what is called a containment hierarchy, at the top
of which must be a top-level container.

Swing components are derived from the **JComponent**

* JButton
* JCheckBox
* JComboBox
* JList
* JTable
* JTextField
* ...

Swing defines two types of containers.

The first are top-level containers:

* JFrame
* JApplet
* JWindow
* JDialog

Others are lightweigth containers:

* JPanel
* JScrollPane
* JLayeredPane
* JTabbedPane
* ...

```
Sample application 1 window 1 button goes here
```

```
Extend the samle with other components (label, checkbox, combobox) ...
```

## Event handling

In swing event handling is made by using **Listeners**

Listener interfaces and Adapter classes can be used as listeners.

Processing usually should be done in worker thread, not in event-handling thread.

```
Example of action listener
```

## Paint in component

```
Example of overriding paintComponent() of JPanel
```

## Complex components

* JList
* JTable
* JList

Using of models for complex coponents.

## Layouts

* BorderLayout
* BoxLayout
* CardLayout
* FlowLayout
* GridLayout
* GridBagLayout
* GroupLayout
* SpringLayout

## Menu

* JMenuBar
* JMenu
* JMenuItem
* JCheckBoxMenuItem
* JRadioButtonMenuItem
* JSeparator
* JPopupMenu
